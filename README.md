# 11ty/Galleventy

Hello! I’m Meaghan Gallant, a copywriter learning to code. 

This project is for my personal website which I’m building from scratch using 11ty/eleventy. I’ll be documenting my experience along the way and hope my perspective as a “low-coder” can help out other beginners with their own ambitious projects. 

## Project Status

**Phase 01**: Getting set up

* Chromebook dev environment setup
* Choosing a static site generator (SSG)
