To Discuss:

* naming folders
  * you can name the folders whatever you want
* folder structure
  * you can also arrange them however you want
* tutorials can and WILL name/structure differently from defaults but **not** explicitly tell you 
* you MUST tell your config file what your folder names are or your site is going to spit SO many errors at build 
* discuss *how* to organize your files 
* as a beginner KISS when it comes to the folder structure  
  * discuss the default folder names and structure

Questions & Research:

* does an underscore in front of a folder traditionally mean it will be unread/ignored? or is it a human-eye visual signifier that it is?
