To Discuss:

* the 11ty.dev getting started tutorial -> just...skip it 
* with eleventy markdown files are turned *into* HTML files at "build time"
* markdown files + Nunjucks templates = HTML files when built
* why would you want this? (this meaning seperating the written content (md) from the HTML (njx) )
* kind of compares to WordPress and block builders... like universal/global elements/blocks
