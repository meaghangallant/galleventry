To Discuss: 

* folder names & structure, plus the config directory file
* the HTML confusion from 11ty.dev getting started tutorial
* Chromebook dev environment
  * know your chromebook hardware and linux distro (and how to find them)
* bash/command line/terminal 
  * commands used for set up
  * tricks I learned -> like ctrl + c to escape "watching" part after the 11ty builds
  * that website you can paste commands into and it explains to you what they are
  * bash and command line tuts I've learned from (freeCodeCamp and codecademy)
* if you aren't familair with markdown... you might actually be (notion uses it! trello uses it! even google docs can use it!)
  * think of it as keyboard shortcuts for text styles -> *definitely* so much easier than writing a whole page of content in HTML
